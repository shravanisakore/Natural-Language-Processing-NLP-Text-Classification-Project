# Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-Text-Classification-Project



## Overview
This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to perform **text classification**. The workflow includes:

- **Preprocessing** textual data (removing stopwords, tokenization, stemming, etc.)
- **Feature extraction** using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**
- **Training classification models** such as:
  - Naïve Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
- **Performance evaluation** of models to determine their effectiveness

This project provides hands-on experience in building a complete **NLP pipeline** for real-world text classification tasks.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed along with the necessary dependencies.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**
gh repo clone shravanisakore/Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-Text-Classification-Project
   ```
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (Optional but recommended)**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Results & Insights
- The **Logistic Regression model** performed better in terms of accuracy and precision compared to Naïve Bayes.
- **Feature engineering** plays a crucial role in improving classification results.
- **Further improvements** can be made using deep learning techniques like LSTMs or Transformers.
